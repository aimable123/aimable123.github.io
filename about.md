I am a Rwandan. I have a bachelor’s degree acquired from University of Rwanda and two masters acquired from African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) – Rwanda. I have a background in mathematical sciences, machine intelligence and computer engineering. My expertise lies in data analysis, data visualization, statistical learning and data engineering. I have done a six months internship at Rwanda Environmental Management Authority under Mathematical Science for Climate Resilience and a three months internship at AIMS – Ishango fellowship program patterned with international companies solving real life problem. I have trained data science in Kenyan companies where I trained trainees from different fields like finance, consultant, and so forth.
